# trooff

Troof is a fictional pro-bono/charity website that helps those living in poverty. This organization raises donations through traditional monetary donations and also sells pottery through it's e-shop.

This project is my first attempt at Python and the Django framwork. After finishing the Flatiron Bootcamp, I wanted to pick up another language and Python was my choice.

For this particular project, most of the html/css was already written and after learning Python, I decided to try and learn Django and adapt the written front-end to the Django framework. It might have be overkill to use a framework. However, I was able to learn and pick up a lot. Also got to experience working with someone else's code and move or port over if you will, to another style of platform.
