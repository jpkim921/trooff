# trooff

Troof is a fictional pro-bono/charity website that helps those living in poverty. This organization raises donations through traditional monetary donations and also sells pottery through it's e-shop.

This project is my first attempt at Python and the Django framwork. After finishing the Flatiron Bootcamp, I wanted to pick up another language and Python was my choice.
